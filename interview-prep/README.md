# Interview Preparation for Embedded Roles

## Computer Architecture

CPU needs it’s own “memory” called Registers.<br>
Registers are small, very fast circuits that store intermediate
values from calculations or instructions inside the CPU.<br>
There are many small units, but the four most important ones are the following:<br>
1. **MAR** is connected to the address bus.
2. **MDR** contains a memory address.
3. **Accumulator** holds the intermediate results of the currently running instructions.
4. **Program Counter** holds the memory address of the next instruction.
